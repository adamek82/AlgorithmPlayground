# Algorithm Playground

A personal collection of **algorithmsâ€¯&â€¯dataâ€‘structures exercises** written in modern C++20.  
Each exercise lives in its own header/implementation pair and is verified by a small,
selfâ€‘contained test harness so you can build and run everything outâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘box with CMake.

---

## Assumptions & Goals

* **Learningâ€‘byâ€‘doing** â€“ every directory showcases a single classical problem or dataâ€‘structure.
* **Clean APIs, tight bounds** â€“ each solution targets the asymptotic complexity quoted in the
  exercise description.
* **Zero external dependencies** â€“ everything builds with a stock C++20 compiler.
* **Editorâ€‘friendly** â€“ workspace files are provided for VSÂ Code + the CMake Tools extension.

## Project Layout

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt            # root build script
â”œâ”€â”€ include/                  # public headers (one per exercise)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ClosestPairSolver.h
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ inMemoryDb.h
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ â€¦
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                      # implementations + test runner
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ClosestPairSolver.cpp
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ inMemoryDb.cpp
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AlgorithmPlayground.cpp
â”œâ”€â”€ bin/                      # CMake runtime output (gitâ€‘ignored)
â””â”€â”€ .vscode/                  # launch / build / intellisense settings
```

`AlgorithmPlayground.cpp` is the single **executable entryâ€‘point**; it pulls in each
exerciseâ€™s unit tests so that a *single* run gives a green (or red!) report.

## Implemented Exercises

| # | Topic | Files | Key Points |
|---|-------|-------|------------|
| 1 | **Closest Pair of Points** (Geometry) | `ClosestPairSolver.*` | Divideâ€‘&â€‘conquer, \(O(n log n)\) time, \(O(n)\) extra space |
| 2 | **Inâ€‘Memory Transactional KVâ€‘Store** | `inMemoryDb.*` | Hashâ€‘table CRUD with nested `BEGINâ€¯/â€¯ROLLBACKâ€¯/â€¯COMMIT`; \(O(1)\) avg time per op |

More exercises will be added over time â€“ feel free to open an issue or PR with suggestions!

## Building & Running

```bash
# configure outâ€‘ofâ€‘source
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
# compile
cmake --build build
# run the bundled tests
build/AlgorithmPlayground      # or bin/Release/AlgorithmPlayground on MSVC
```

On Windows with VSÂ Code, simply press **F5** (launch configuration is bundled).

## Contributing

1. Fork / clone the project.
2. Drop your new header & cpp into `include/` and `src/`.
3. Add tests to `AlgorithmPlayground.cpp`.
4. Run `clang-format` (or `std::format`Â ðŸ˜‰) and open a PR. Happy hacking!
